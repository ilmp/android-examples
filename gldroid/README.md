Simple example of OpenGL ES 2.0 usage in Android. Many techniques are demonstrated.

The application shows two cubes rotating around a chest. One
cube is textured (like a wooden box) and the other has just multi-colored faces.
The chest is loaded from a OBJ file and textured.
On touch movements the cubes rotate around themselves. There is a light in the
front, so the cube far to the back gets darker.

In this example you will find:
* Basic concepts: vertex, triangles, projection, camera, color, framerate control
* Translation and rotation
* Vertex and fragment shaders
* Texture
* Depth Buffer
* Cull face
* Ambient and diffuse lighting
* OBJ files loading (mesh)
