multitouchdroid
===============

Example of multitouch events handling on Android.

This application has a custom view which draws a green circle in the position a
touch event occurs, and a smaller grey circle where the touch event ends. In
other words, when you put a finger on the screen, a green circle will appear in
the position you touched. When you remove a finger, a smaller grey circle will
appear in the position the finger was removed. This works for up to 10 fingers,
a.k.a pointers.
